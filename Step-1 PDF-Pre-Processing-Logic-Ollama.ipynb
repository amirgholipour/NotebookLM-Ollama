For training the student LM, the rationales serve as a means to retrieve relevant knowledge and the student LM is subsequently fine-tuned using the rationales along with questions and knowledge. However, during inference only questions are available. To address this the Reranker is trained to mimic how the retriever scores passages with the rationale by minimizing the KL divergence between Retriever (d|r)andReranker (d|x). However...\n",
